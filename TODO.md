# To-Dos

- Add forgot password implementation
- Add auth middleware
- Actually process heartbeats (LOL)
- Add ratelimiting to the /api/heartbeat and /api/heartbeats endpoints
  - Might be worth implementing authentication/authorization/ratelimiting as a middleware
- Implement settings
- Restrict image lengths
- Projects chart looks pretty bad in general
- There's both a `created_at` and `time` field for heartbeats
- Write tests (API/browser tests)
- See how Quackatime copes with scale
  - 100k heartbeats
  - 600k heartbeats
  - 5 million heartbeats
- Add API key regeneration
  - **Keep in sync w/ api_key column**
- Get API key for user via Better Auth, not via separate `api_key` column
- Move off github-colors package (or at the very least, write types for it!)
  - <https://www.npmjs.com/package/linguist-languages> has a way smaller bundle size
- After signing up, you're redirected to the sign in page instead of the setup page
- Add email verification
- Add "Forgot your password?"
- Add GitHub OAuth
